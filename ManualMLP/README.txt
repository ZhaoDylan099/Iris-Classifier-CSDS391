NeuralNetwork.py is the file containing the code for Exercise 1, 2, and 3.



To run the code, make sure numpy, pandas, matplotlib is installed in your conda environment.
Additionally, make sure irisdata.csv is in the same folder as k_means.py. Then in the terminal, navigate to the folder containing k_means.py files, and in the terminal type:

	python k_means.py

This code was run on vscode in case matplotlib is not displaying the graph correctly. If a graph is not being displayed, run the code using vscode. 


Important Information on Graph Locations
--------------------------------------------
For exercises 1 and 2, the graphs will appear as popups. Close each graph to view the next one. For exercise 3, the graphs are stored within their corresponding question folder. This is due to the numerous number of graphs as well as to prevent confusion among which graphs go to which question. The file path for where each corresponding questions's plot is outputted through the code.
